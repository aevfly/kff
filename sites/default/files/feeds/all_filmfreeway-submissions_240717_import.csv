They couldn’t believe it. They wouldn’t believe it. He’s coming here? Surely it can’t be. And yet . . .
Eight years after it was host city to the 14th Winter Olympics, Sarajevo fell in to the inner circle of hell from which it took nearly four years to escape. 
The Siege of Sarajevo was one of the great human disasters of the 20th Century, which is saying something, the longest of any capital city in modern history producing the worst atrocities in post war Europe. 
Inside the city life was intolerable; if the inhabitants survived the sniper’s bullets trying to buy food, they were reduced to cooking it over open fires made from smashed furniture.
Deprived of power, light and clean running water families lived in basements for safety from the constant mortar shells.
And these families were the lucky ones; others were forcibly divided as mothers with rifles at their backs were compelled on pain of death to leave their children. 
Every day for over 1000 days, the citizens of Sarajevo struggled to stay alive, but this was no life. Amidst it all however, for some there was one bright light, one source of hope; the greatest escape of all for the trapped mind - music. 
Deep in the heart of the Siege of Sarajevo young men with long hair, owning guitars silenced by lack of electricity and motorbikes stilled by lack of fuel clung to the power of music to make their abnormal lives normal. 
And one man, one rock star, embodied their hope. In this deep, dark hell and for one December night only in front of a crowd unable to believe their eyes and ears, Bruce Dickinson risking life and limb, had traveled into the city most people were desperate to escape and performed a true rock concert.
For a few hours there was no war and under the starry winter sky it was possible to believe that out there, somewhere normal life existed. 
For these young people, God was Almighty that night and he gave them Bruce.That night Bruce Dickinson ran on to the tiny stage in the tiny shell-shocked hall and holding the microphone out cried ‘Scream For Me Sarajevo’; and scream they surely did.";;;01:32:00;Bosnia and Herzegovina;Croatian, English;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3MedSfD57w&t=4s;Bosnia and Herzegovina;http://screamformesarajevo.ba;;;Documentary;war, music, history;No;2016-08-14;;Digital;16:9;Color;;;;;;;No;Tarik Hodzic;Jasenko Pasic;Adnan Cuhara;Bruce Dickinson;;;Black;2016-12-19;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Documentary;$15.00;;https://vimeo.com/195033050;Ar2D2Si3Po;;"Sarajevo Film Festival

another, a lowly dollar bill, ""one buck"" takes us on an odyssey
through the heart of a forgotten town in Louisiana. Along the
journey of ""one buck"", we encounter Harry who is immersed in
a downward spiral brought about by the sudden and violent
death of his wife. In its transitions from each hopeless hand to
another and each desperate character to the next, ""one buck""
bears witness to different facets of irresistible vice enticed by
money. If money could talk, this is its disturbing tale of the dark
side and of moral disintegration in society. Harry's self
destruction is the highlight of the stories and his demise serves
to be his redemption.";;;01:27:32;United States;English;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOMoHMo0SM;United States;http://www.onebuck.us;https://twitter.com/OnebuckContact;https://www.facebook.com/ONE-BUCK-The-Movie-588072244654086/?ref=bookmarks;Feature;;No;2016-10-26;750000 USD;RED;1:85;Color;;;;;;;No;Fabien Dufils;Fabien Dufils;Fabien Dufils, Bassam Abdallah;John Freeman;;;Blue;2016-12-25;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Feature Films;$15.00;;https://vimeo.com/179917967;ONEBUCK_08_23_16_NY_premix01;;;;5663298

He’s a handsome child, he’s rich yet unhappy. He senses that there’s something wrong with his life and this leads him to wander off thanks to his fervid imagination. His greatest wish is to leave the materialistic world behind since he isn’t fond of it. That’s why the only present he wants for Christmas is for Santa Claus to take him away to live in his fairyland toy factory. At the same time, a secret that his family has been keeping for a long time suddenly comes to the surface and it is feared that the worst might happen soon. The expectation for the stroke of midnight on the night before Christmas is transformed into reality for everyone on the eve of something truly different. Something terrible that might happen.

I cast a virtual light on the fluid and as the rays of light passed through the surface they refracted and created the “rippling caustics” on another surface placed beneath the fluid surface. 
While the placement and form of each of the invisible objects is a significant factor in forming the patterns, the repercussive wave formations as they collide with each other and the pool edges create new patterns and compositions.

Farmland lies abandoned, reclaimed by a self-willed natural world: trees are growing where once there were fields; wild animals roam free amongst the debris. 

Away from the pull of our economic centres, marginalised regions are witnessing a demographic and cultural collapse. Ways of life become stories, stories become history, and as the city grows the memory fades.

But things grow from the cracks of ruin, and in the cracks of great change are small stories. In an abandoned alpine valley, one village’s precarious attempt to survive offers a series of reflections on our changing relationship with the countryside and as such with the natural world itself.

Henry's remit is simple, feed Fuseli her cat and sleep there overnight so Fuseli knows he has not been abandoned. But this seemingly simple task turns to fear when his sleep is disturbed by loud incessant night time noises. Henry's fear turns to terror when he gets seized by sleep paralysis, preventing him from moving, just as he feels something unseen climbing over him. ;;;00:13:41;Not Specified;;https://youtu.be/jtv4i015ob8;United States;https://vimeo.com/201631253;;;Short;;No;2017-01-25;10000 USD;Digital;;Color;;;;;;;No;Randy Kent;Paolo Sedazzari;Christof Hackl;Liz Fenning, Chris Ready;;;;2017-01-30;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Short Films;$15.00;;http://vimeo.com/201631253;lucifersam;;;;5847920

A man and woman are trapped in a room. Or are they? They are attracted to each other and have sex. Or do they? Did the man rape the woman? Is she making this up to blackmail him? So many hidden agendas… so many twists – even the protagonists seem to be confused when a third character penetrates the storyline. OPEN WOUND is a story that lingers between Twilight Zone, Yasmina Reza and Bukowski. Inspired by the enormous attention the Kachelmann case received in Germany and the “Strauss Kahn” incident. Juergen R. Weber’s script is about the eternal and unmerciful fight between the male and the female race. A struggle, which leads to blood, sweat and enlightenment. Is it a psycho thriller? Or a love story? A guts and gore piece? A Tale beyond good and evil? Certainly it’s something new. ;;;01:35:47;Germany;English;https://filmfreeway.com/submissions/5893130;Germany;https://openwounddotnet.wordpress.com/;;https://www.facebook.com/OPEN-WOUND-the-%C3%9CBER-movie-233322720162541/;Feature;;No;2017-02-01;225000 USD;Red;2.35 (SCOPE);Color;;;;;;;Yes;Juergen R.

At its peak Pyramida was home to more than 1000 miners and their families. It was evacuated in two days in 1998 leaving a ghost town. ""Катюша (Katyusha)"" presents three fictional characters who personify different aspects of Pyramida. The Guide takes the form of a gray sea bird, the Northern Fulmar. As the piece progresses we discover clues to the identity of two Lovers, a ballet dancer and a basketball player. The elaborately painted floor of the basketball court in Pyramida is a central motif, as is the abandoned ballet studio in the northern most corner of the town – once the most northerly ballet studio on earth. Time becomes unreliable as the viewer jumps back and forth uncontrollably between two time periods. In the 1980s the lovers meet as adolescent young pioneers in the idyllic summer forests of the Ukraine. After the evacuation a mysterious love token is left behind on the tundra amongst the empty shells of Pyramida. The third unspoken time period is only hinted at – always skipped over, never shown – the time that the lovers spent living happily in a town built of dreams at the end of the world. The lonely voice of a Soviet “numbers station” recites the names of the missing.";;;00:28:00;United States;;https://vimeo.com/120762281;Svalbard and Jan Mayen, United States;http://stephenhilyard.com/katyusha.htm;;;Documentary, Experimental, Short;experimental, historical, multi-channel, soviet-union, russia, arctic, ghost-town, love-story;No;2016-09-01;98000 USD;4k digital;16:9;Color;;;;;;;Yes;Stephen Hilyard;;Stephen Hilyard;Maggie Kane, Nolen Meland;;;Black;2017-02-07;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Art;$15.00;;https://vimeo.com/184546120;maggie;;"Wisconsin Triennial

Paolo;Buatti;;;paolo.buatti@gmail.com;;;;;;;;KFF1069;The woodworm;Il tarlo;"""Il Tarlo"" is Italian for ""the woodworm"", an insect that feeds on wood. The same word in slang is often used to communicate a persistent 
thought or an obsession. Software programming, bocce and chess gaming, restoration of old watches and above all woodworking are among the past and present passions of the subject of this portrait.
Though some of these interests may appear very diverse, there is a thread that ties them all together: Francesco says that he wants to ""make the brain work"" and in every endeavor logic and calculation 
are fundamental operations. Even today, entering his tenth decade, Francesco works with wood in his workshop and from a corner in the room you can hear ""il tarlo"" slowly tapping.";"Il tarlo è un insetto che attacca e si nutre della polpa del legno, lo stesso termine nel gergo comune viene usato per indicare un pensiero persistente, un chiodo fisso.
La programmazione software, le bocce, il restauro di antichi orologi, gli scacchi e soprattutto il legno sono alcune delle passioni passate e presenti del protagonista di questo ritratto.
Apparentemente distanti tra loro, sono interessi legati da quella che lui definisce voglia di “far lavorare il cervello”, in qualsiasi campo la logica e il calcolo sono le sue prerogative. Ancora oggi, alla soglia dei novant'anni, Francesco lavora il legno nel suo laboratorio e da un angolo della stanza si sente il picchiettare del tarlo.";;00:21:56;Italy;Italian;https://vimeo.com/178720348;Italy;http://www.iltarlodoc.it;;;Documentary, Short;;No;2016-09-23;;Digital;16:9;Color;;;;;;;No;Paolo Buatti;;Paolo Buatti;Francesco Diletti;;;;2017-02-07;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Documentary;$15.00;;https://filmfreeway.com/submissions/5905227;;;;;5905227
Avi;Anurag;1999-08-07;Male;avianurag@outlook.com;;;;Mumbai;;;India;KFF1071;Drum Roles;;"I am extremely passionate about drumming. My drum teacher (a professional musician), has often told me about how he enjoys playing Western musical styles like jazz, but professionally, is forced to play more popular styles (like Bollywood) in order to make a living. The fact that my teacher always helped me express myself in whatever styles I was fond of, but at the same time wasn’t free to express himself how he wanted to, intrigued me and inspired me to make this film.

In the film, I have shown glimpses of his daily life, exploring the life of a musician in India.  However, the focus of the film is split between the life of my teacher and my own introspections on the role that drumming plays in MY life. Thus, the title of the film implies the different ‘roles’ the drums play in both our lives, while also being a play on the popular technique, ‘drum roll,’";;;00:17:11;India;English;;India;;;;Documentary, Experimental, Short, Student;Music;Yes;2016-06-30;;Digital;;Color;;;;;;;Yes;Avi Anurag;;;;;;;2017-02-10;In Consideration;Undecided;Earlybird Deadline;Short Films;$10.00;;https://filmfreeway.com/submissions/5920832;;;;;5920832

In the 1960s Lawry a young Goan musician playing in the nightclubs of Bombay, returns to Goa to find a singer for his band where he meets Dona. While Lawry moulds the impressionable young Dona into a talented singer, they fall deeply in love. The emotional rollercoaster of a love story is destined to tragedy.

The film weaves its lilting narrative through 20 timeless songs 
Based on actual events this quasi-biographical film is a tribute to one of Goa’s greatest, yet barely acknowledged legacy - its musicians, who once upon a time set the jazz clubs of Bombay on fire and actually shaped the music of Bollywood cinema.  
Nachom-ia Kumpasar is a nostalgic musical tale set in the times these musicians lived and died in - unrecognized, unappreciated…and unsung.

The film takes place in a nursing home where mother is working for years. Grandmother used to be a headmaster of the same nursing home and she devoted her life to it. Now she is just one of the inhabitants. She doesn't want to accept weakness of the old age.
Granddaughter is trying to animate grandmother with her camera but their play is interrupted every time mother enters into the room and reality becomes the main character.
Memories are built to keep grandmother alive but her desire to leave is too strong.

For many climbers, it is an even greater prize than Everest, with limited routes, a steeper ascent, and a harder push to its summit. Nicknamed the 'Savage Mountain,' K2's peak is so much higher than the rest of the surrounding range that it juts unprotected into the atmosphere, regularly exposing climbers to life-threatening weather conditions. In 2008, a tragic disaster on K2 claimed the lives of 11 mountaineers.

Four of those who lost their lives in the disaster were porters hired to carry the equipment and provisions of foreign climbing expeditions. Despite being paid at rates far below those received by international expedition leaders, such porters – whether they provide critical supplies to expedition base camps or take on higher-altitude tasks in support of ascending climbers – take on difficult and dangerous work. These efforts make them worthy of recognition as the true heroes of mountaineering.

In K2 AND THE INVISIBLE FOOTMEN, filmmaker Iara Lee and her team chronicle the lives of those who make possible ascents of the world's tallest mountains, including both Pakistani porters and Nepalese sherpas. The film also follows the first official all-Pakistani climbing team, made up of former porters. This team successfully summited in 2014, on the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of the mountain. Amid breathtaking scenery, the film depicts the everyday sacrifices of porters and the courage of those indigenous climbers who choose to return to scale K2 in spite of past tragedies. In their striving to perfect their craft, these mountaineers provide a fresh look into the cultures and national traditions of Pakistan, a country typically portrayed in the foreign media as merely a land of conflict and sectarian strife.

A kilencvenes években Ungvárról jött Budapestre tanulni - sikeresebb élet reményében. Számára Magyarország volt a nyugat, csakúgy, mint minden határon átjött kollégiumi társa számára. Bár mindig is asztrofizikus szeretett volna lenni, családja miatt mégis inkább gyakorlatiasabb szakmát választott, hogy fenn tudja tartani számukra az anyagi biztonságot. Multinacionális cégeknél eltöltött évek után szerény tőkével végre sikerül megvennie egy vállalatot, amely nevének itt Magyarországon nagy a presztízse: a Tisza Cipőgyárat. Hiába viszont a nagy név, az egykor híres vállalat rég elvesztette a fényét a hetvenes évek óta, és egy haldokló, ex-szocialista igáslóvá vált munkagépek és piac nélkül, súlyos adósságokat felhalmozva. András mégis elhatározza, hogy életre kelti a jószágot, elindítja a folyamatos termelést, állandó munkahelyeket teremt, újra megnyeri a katonai cipőgyártói pályázatot és szinte egyedüliként divatot visz a munkacipőkbe.

In 1954, the public records were destroyed and in the 1980s a few brave men and women began working to reclaim this chapter in history and ensure future generations would know about it.

Loosely based on the 1961 French Cinema Verité film, ‘Chronique d’un été,’ the participants of A Weird Kind of Love are similarly impelled to confront their attitudes towards happiness, truth and reality.

In expressing the weird kind of love they have for London, the city becomes a blank canvas, enabling the featured Londoners to affirm their continually evolving identities.

Monuments are silent witnesses to the times when they were built and the people who built them. Through monuments one can trace the history of human kind. Monuments teach us about different customs, religions, cultures, economies, wars and social norms. Had their monuments not been preserved many peoples would have perished without a trace. Thousands of monuments were built throughout the former Yugoslavia in the 1945-1990 period to commemorate the sites where World War II battles had been fought and to promote antifascism. These monuments were once favorite destinations for school trips and political gatherings, as well as a necessary part of all family photos. The main focus of this film is the destiny of these monuments as secondary raw materials.;;;01:40:00;Croatia;Croatian;https://vimeo.com/175658673;Croatia;http://www.irenaskoric.com;;;Documentary;;No;2016-08-18;50000 USD;Digital cinema;16:9;Color;;;;;;;No;Irena Skoric;Irena Skoric;Irena Skoric;Ivo Josipovic, Silvije Magdic;;;;2017-05-11;In Consideration;Undecided;Extended Deadline;Documentary;$45.00;;https://vimeo.com/178240511;mejefjf985749;;"Sarajevo film festival

The importance of the impact of the virtual is a daily key question. Can our brain still makes the difference in order not to become confused and    create and value an unreal past? To be virtual or not to be. Would it be the updated question?

A group of friends meet for an aperitif. Each is having to deal with life's problems and hopes. The situation creates tensions. At some point, one of the guests disappears. Are the guests real or virtual? Making light of the answer can be risky. Justice is blind and decides. The brain does, too, occasionally.

The film involves a double road to the abyss.  Even though the virtual world or a story retold has no material reality, it will be real for our brain, for the simple reason that in both cases, the story can generate actions with painful consequences that will happen in the concrete world. The audience itself will experience this. At the beginning of the film, they think they are witnessing a cocktail among friends, but in fact, the characters are all avatars and the story is one told by a fake tattoo artist attempting to explain a failed drawing. Any exposure to a virtual or reported story will change us, because it constitutes real material for our brains. So nothing is unreal.";"Le virtuel n’est plus le frère cadet du réel mais son jumeau, avec pour même parc d’attractions, notre cerveau.

L'importance de l'impact du virtuel est une question clé quotidienne. Notre cerveau est-il toujours capable de faire la différence afin de ne pas confondre, créer et préférer un passé inexistant ? ""To be virtual or not to be"" est-elle la mise à jour de cette question fondamentale?

Des amis se retrouvent pour un apéritif, chacun exacerbé par sa problématique de vie et ses espoirs. Ce contexte génère des tensions conduisant jusqu’à la la mort d’un des convives. Réels ou virtuels convives, la légèreté d’appréciation peut être douloureuse. La justice est aveugle et tranche, parfois le cerveau aussi.

Ce film est composé d’une double mise en abîme. Il démontre que bien que le virtuel ou une histoire racontée n’aient pas une réalité matériel, ils demeurent cependant au statut de réel pour notre cerveau car ils peuvent engendrer, dans les deux cas, des actes d’une conséquence douloureuse s’inscrivant dans le concret. Le public en fait  lui-même l’expérience croyant assister au début du film à un apéritif entre amis alors qu’il s’agit d’avatars et d’une histoire rapportée par un tatoueur imposteur tentant de justifier son dessin raté. Toute exposition à une histoire virtuelle ou racontée nous changent car elle constitue un matériel réel pour notre cerveau.
